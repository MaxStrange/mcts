# Monte Carlo Tree Search
This repository is for some simple console-based games that use MCTS as a way to learn it.

There are two games: Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4.

To play a game and see how well you can do against the computer:
`python3 main.py games/connect4/connect4.py ai/uct.py`

The logic has been modularized well enough that you can look at the AI module without
worrying about how the games actually work at all.
